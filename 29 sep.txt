Oops:
 1.Object oriented programming language which is used in various programming languages 
 2.It is used that for secure programming and for reusability
Class:
 1.It is like a blueprint or template.
 2.It is like a data type but not a data type in which we can do the various activities like creating the objects ,methods etc
Object:
 1.It is nothing but the real entity which is nothing but here the memory allocation starts 
 2.The object is created with the help of the new key word
Methods :
 1.Methods are nothing but the like the functions only but it will give a return value
 2.These are done inside the class so that multiple methods can be created inside a class and it can be used for multiple times
 3.The methods can be passed by using ref,out,params
   1.ref is nothing but Basically, it means that any change made to a value that is passed by reference will reflect this change since you are modifying the value at the address and not just the value.
   2.out it is used for passing and getting the multiple values 
   3.params it is used for passing the arrays and for multiple value but the params should in the last.
Constructor:
 1.It is just like a method it is created with the class by default and it can be created as the user defined too
