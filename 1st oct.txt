Inheritance:
 1.It is the ability to inherit the fields from the another class.
 2.It will be having base or parent class and there will be child class which inherits the fields from the parent class
   example:  class A{}
             class B:A
 3.The inheritance can be done to multilevel that is the one class can only access the fields of one class
 4.The multiple inheritance is not possible in c#
Polymorphism:
 1.It is the ability to take more than one form 
 2.In other words derived class object can point to the base class reference variable and it is possible to override
 example:    public virtual void name{} //base class
             public override void name{}//child class
Struct:
 1.Struct is nothing but a used for storing data 
 2.It is like a value type that is used to store the data in stack
 3.The data will be lost after the termination of the loop
Interface:
 1.It is nothing but a method that has no body.
 2.It is used for performing the multiple inheritance
 3.It is used for just declaration purpose only not for implementation
 example:    interface name{ void name()}
             interface name1{void name()}
             class A:name,name1
